This project was assigned for completing Data Analyst Course by [Narasio Data](https://narasiodata.com)

## Problem
1. Distribution of payment type made by customers?
2. Distribution of customer city?
3. What products are often searched by customers?

## Used Technologies
1. Jupyter Notebook - Text editor
2. Library SQlite3 - for extracting data from the dataset
3. Library pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn

## Development Steps
* Connect library SQlite to Python - so can access the dataset
* Data Preparation using SQL - make dataframe using ```Pandas``` module and ```read_sql_query``` function
* Data Cleansing - Checking missing values, data duplicates, and data types
* Exploratory Data - Explored the data for completing the problem statement and using library ```matplotlib``` or ```seaborn``` to visualize that data

## Conclusion
The answer to the problem statement is:
  * Credit card is the highest and debit card is the lowest by frequency usage. Credit cards are usually used because customers enjoy 0% installment promos or discounts provided by outlets where customers shop

  * Many customers came from Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The reason why many customers come from these two cities is that the population in Brazil is concentrated in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro [information](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/cities/brazil). So, it is inevitable that many Olist e-Commerce customers come from these two cities.
